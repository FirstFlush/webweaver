brake.*?bundle(?:s)?

Requirements
-contains the word 'brake'
-contains the word 'bundle' or 'bundles' at any point after brake 
-an indeterminate number of characters, words, spaces, special characters, numbers etc between brake and bundle/bundles
-brake can be its own word or a part of other words. so "bigbrake" and "oem-brake" would both match just as well as "brake". and "kits/bundles" would match just as well as "bundle"
